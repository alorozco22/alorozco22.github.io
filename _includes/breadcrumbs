Works much like nav-list, passing child items to itself
as new parameters to drill down through web-nav-tree,
and outputting only list items relevant to the current file.
Include in content with {% include breadcrumbs breadcrumb-tree=web-nav-tree %}.
The crumbs-array is created empty in _includes/metadata.

{% if include.breadcrumb-tree %}
    {% for item in include.breadcrumb-tree %}

        {% comment %}Put the label and link, if there is a link,
        in a variable called 'label'{% endcomment %}

        {% comment %}Add that label to an array of crumbs.
        This array is empty the first time this include runs, and then
        each time it includes itseld, the array fills with the crumbs
        it created on its previous run. It left breadcrumbs where it walked!
        Each crumb in the array is a potential parent of the crumbs
        that we'll create on the next pass.{% endcomment %}
        {% assign crumbs-array = crumbs-array | push: label %}

        {% comment %}If the item we're on has children, put them in a variable.{% endcomment %}
        {% assign children = item.children %}

        {% comment %}As we run through the breadcrumb-tree, we're looking for the name
        of the current HTML file we're generating. When the names match:
        - create a list item for each crumb we've collected in the crumbs-array, and
        - add a list item for the file we're generating.
        Voila, a list of parents in the breadcrumb tree, ending with the current file.{% endcomment %}
        {% if item.file == current-file %}
            {% for crumb in include.crumbs-array %}
                <li>{{ crumb | strip | markdownify | remove: '<p>' | remove: '</p>' | strip_newlines }}</li>
            {% endfor %}
            <li>{{ item.label | markdownify | remove: '<p>' | remove: '</p>' | strip_newlines }}</li>
            {% comment %}We don't break here because some files
            appear more than once in nav/breadcrumbs.{% endcomment %}

        {% comment %}If we've not yet found the current file in the breadcrumb-tree,
        let's go looking for it in this breadcrumb-tree item's children.
        To do that, include this include again, using the children as the breadcrumb-tree
        to look through. And pass along the crumbs-array we've collected so far.{% endcomment %}
