# Experiment 1: Materials and resources

For this activity you need:
* Markers, one per group.
* Many sheets of recycled paper.
* Optional: a picture of the paper airplane instructive diagram. You may use a video beam to project it; or, you may explain the instructions by yourself while doing an example airplane.

## Templates and documents

You may use Excel *Format 1.1.* to record your students results. This document contains a table where you should enter your classroom production results. Given the data, the format automatically estimates the regression coefficients. Additionally, you get an immediate plot of the estimated production function of your individual classroom. You can use this material to process the data and start a discussion in less than two minutes after the experiment.
