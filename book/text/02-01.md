## Introduction

Is it possible to predict the aggregate behavior of a group after hundreds of individual decentralized decisions?

Economic theory proposes that individual willingness to accept and willingness to pay a price generate supply and demand curves ([Unit 8.1](https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/08.html#81-buying-and-selling-demand-and-supply)). Markets reach a competitive equilibrium based on pursuit of personal benefits (under certain conditions) ([Unit 8.5](https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/08.html#85-competitive-equilibrium-gains-from-trade-allocation-and-distribution)). In general, the economy keeps moving between different equilibriums. When market conditions change, supply and demand curves transform as well ([Unit 8.6](https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/08.html#86-changes-in-supply-and-demand)). Taxes have a major role in perceived individual incentives; therefore, they have the ability to alter market balance ([Unit 8.7](https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/08.html#87-the-effects-of-taxes)).

This activity recreates a free market under controlled conditions to generate a decentralized equilibrium. Students will be assigned a role as potato producers or retailers. Given their conditions (production costs and reselling prices) students will have to take decisions related to trading their commodities. After a number of rounds, the market will face a shock (tax imposition). Theory predicts prices will increase on average; and, the number of transactions will be reduced by this shock.
