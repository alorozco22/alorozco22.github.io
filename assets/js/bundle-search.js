    title: "A note to instructors",
    content: "Note to instructors\n\nOur purpose\nPersonal experience is a powerful teaching tool. Experiments in Economics is designed to provide teachers a complete set of materials to reduce the necessary effort while maximizing the reached advantages of class experiments. However, while running experiments in class is an innovative technique, it is already a very popularized practice. Next, we show some of the strategies you may have in mind to use this book. Then, we provide a brief mention to some of the external platforms you may explore for more information on class experiments.\n\nThe content\nFirst, Experiments in Economics is not just a manual with a list of ready protocols. We believe experiments should be related to the theory, questions and conclusions economics has to offer. Additionally, we understand experiments require time and careful logistic planning. Therefore, each experiment is related to the relevant units in The Economy. We recommend you see each unit in this book as a direct companion to the correspondent units in The Economy. On the other hand, each experiment comes with a group of materials. According to the case, a unit may contain some or all the next:\n\n  A ready-to-use protocol: with an outline of the instructions you should give to your students.\n  Excel preconfigured formats: with downloadable tables ready to register your data and perform automatic analysis.\n  Predesigned printable tables: with clear information your students need to participate in the activities, and physical formats to register actions.\n  Video tutorials: with introductory tours to external platforms.\n  Informative diagrams: with complementary information to communicate instructions to your students.\n\n\nWe present a base version of each experiment. Nevertheless, feel free to use the tools you consider more useful; and, modify any part of the design you prefer according to your pedagogical needs.\n\nHow to use Experiments in Economics\n\nThere are at least three ways you can articulate to use the present materials. First, a course about a theoretical introduction to economics is a perfect environment to first expose students to the living decision making process through experiments. For example, you may select some units to use during a microeconomics, macroeconomics, or games theory course. In this case, we recommend you use this material simultaneously with The Economy. Briefly, you may create a dialog between theory and personal experiences.\n\nSecond, some of these experiments are suitable for an experimental methodology course. According to the concepts you want to illustrate, you may need to modify some of the contents. For example, to give your students an idea behind the treatments design, you may want to make small edits to the protocol behind a dictator game and assign them randomly to groups in your class. However, the general idea behind the classic experiment can still be understood through our materials.\n\nOn a third place, you may want to illustrate specific concepts that are not present explicitly in this book. You may select some of a unit’s content as a base model to modify materials, instead of working them out from scratch. For instance, you may take the templates for a double auction experiment and change the kind of shock the market experiences: a supply reduction, instead of a tax. Then, the book works as a complement to any related class project.\n\nFinally, Experiments in Economics is not a book to be completely used at a single course, neither is it a sequential text. The materials presented in here are thought to be a guide or manual with multiple purposes. Feel free to use it as you better consider.\n\nAn open window\n\nAs mentioned before, there is an extensive variety of other free resources you may consult as a reference to experimental economics. Next, we mention some of them. We strongly encourage you to explore them and find the tools that better fit your pedagogical interests.\n\nClassEx\n\nA widely used online tool developed by the University of Passau. Students may login from their smartphones. Games are designed to study many fields: from political science to economic strategic interaction.\n\nMarietta College\n\nAn outstanding compilation by Greg Delemeester and Jurgen Brauer of more than 170 well documented non-computerized experiments. The platform was developed by the Marietta College. You will find a clean reference with the associated concepts and procedure for each game.\n\nMobLab\n\nAn elegant graphical online tool. You will find an efficient mobile-first platform with microeconomics, games theory, macroeconomics experiments (among others). Students will see clear graphical interfaces in each game. Developed by founders from Caltech. Its services come subject to a price.\n\nVeconLab\n\nMany experiments require a difficult logistic organization. Computer programs are a brilliant tool to implement experiments in class and outside the classroom as pedagogical tools. The University of Virginia provides a fully online implemented tool with more than 60 experiments to use in teaching or research.\n",

    content: "\nExperiment 1 Paper airplanes factory\n\nLearning objectives\n\nIn this project your students will get familiar with some concepts related to chapters 2 (Technology, population and growth), and 3 (Scarcity, Work, and Choice) including:\n\n\n  Key concepts\n\n  \n    Production function\n    Marginal product\n    Diminishing marginal productivity\n    Production inputs\n    Ceteris paribus assumption\n  \n\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat will happen to a firm that doubles its number of workers in comparison to a static one? The answer may be quite surprising.\n\nThe relationship between production inputs and outputs is described by the firm’s production function (Unit 2.7). According to Malthus model, increasing production inputs results in a bigger amount of product. General evidence is consistent with this. It’s key to remember that this relationship assumes everything remains unchanged except the variation in the input levels (Unit 3.1). However, theory suggests that a marginal increase of the input will provide a smaller increase in the output level; thus, increasing an input will reduce its the average product.\n\nThis experiment presents the case of a paper airplanes industry. The class will be divided into firms. Each student will be assigned a group (firm). The production inputs will be labor (number of people at the firm), capital (paper and markers) and land (space at the table). However, it’s key that only one of these factors varies across groups: labor. The other endowments must remain fixed. Theory predicts that firms with bigger amount of labor (workers) will have an inferior average product of labor.\n\n\n  Get started\n\n\n",

Others will have more.\n  Each of the firms will have a fixed space endowment on the table. It’s important that you use exclusively the assigned space.\n  There will be groups of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 students.\n  All of you should produce this paper airplane with the mark XYZ Airlines on it.\n\n\nNext, you should describe the instructions to build a simple paper airplane as shown in Figure 1.1.\n\nFigure 1.1. Paper airplane folding instructions\n\n\nThen, you may proceed:\n\n  You can use as much recycled paper as you need. You will have 3 minutes to fold as many papers as possible. Remember you can only use one marker.\n  Once the time is over, I will give the announce; and, you should stop folding to report how many airplanes did your firm build.\n\n\nNext, you shall create groups with your students, depending on the number of people you have in total. Preferably, make groups of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 individuals. If you have more students, repeat some of this groups in a balanced way.\n\nOnce the students are ready with the materials and assigned spaces, you should give the order and start a stopwatch. Give the “stop” order when the time is over. You may use the suggested table to register the results. Be careful that the students use the assigned materials and space.\n\nClass discussion\n\nOnce you finish the experiment, you may present a scatter plot with a predicted tendency similar to Figure 1.2.\n\nFigure 1.2. Paper airplanes production function\n\n\nYou may present a linear tendency first and then a logarithmic one to discuss the difference between both cases: constant vs diminishing labor productivity. You may recognize the theoretical prediction in the plot. The slope of the tangent line to the production function should decrease as the number of workers increases. You may boost the discussion with some of these questions:\n\n\n  Why do additional workers contribute less than the first worker to the total product?\n  Could it be possible to keep a constant labor productivity out of this classroom (without moving anything else)? Would it be possible to double the production by doubling the number of workers? Why?\n  What do you think would have happened if some firms had an additional table of space? Could they double their production by doubling the number of workers?\n\n\n\n  Materials and resources\n\n\n",

Markets reach a competitive equilibrium based on pursuit of personal benefits (under certain conditions) (Unit 8.5). In general, the economy keeps moving between different equilibriums. When market conditions change, supply and demand curves transform as well (Unit 8.6). Taxes have a major role in perceived individual incentives; therefore, they have the ability to alter market balance (Unit 8.7).\n\nThis activity recreates a free market under controlled conditions to generate a decentralized equilibrium. Students will be assigned a role as potato producers or retailers. Given their conditions (production costs and reselling prices) students will have to take decisions related to trading their commodities. After a number of rounds, the market will face a shock (tax imposition). Theory predicts prices will increase on average; and, the number of transactions will be reduced by this shock.\n\n\n  Get started\n\n\n",

They will be assigned a role between potato producer and retailer. You should choose some students to be logistics assistants. Some of them will check the validity of transactions. Another assistant will enter the data in the contracts to the Excel template while running the experiment (see materials and resources). It’s recommended to have at least 5 assistants per each 70 participants.\n\nIt’s an exciting practice to write down theoretical predictions in a sealed envelope to open it after the experiment. Remember you should print individual cards with roles and market conditions for your participants before the experiment. You will find them in the materials and resources section.

They will be given to growers only.\n      An accounting format you may use to keep track of your individual performance in each day.\n    \n  \n  You don’t have to trade both potato sacks if you don’t want. You can choose to sell or buy the number of sacks you prefer (between zero and two).\n  However, each transaction you make, will determine earnings for you:\n    \n      For potato growers, your earnings will be the difference between the price you negotiated and your production costs. (Give an example with prices).\n      For retailers, your earnings will be the difference between your reselling price and the negotiated price with growers.

Numbers one will have a role; and, the rest will have the contrary.\n\nRun the first 5 rounds of the experiment with a timer.\nGive your students the next instructions in round 6:\n\n  From now on, a tax policy will be applied to producers. If you are a potato grower, your marginal costs will be the ones described in your cards plus (mention the tax amount and an example with any marginal cost).\n  The assistants will register and confirm this operation during transactions. Take that into account. Therefore, earnings for growers will be the difference between the negotiated price and their marginal costs plus the tax (give a numeric example).\n\n\nClass discussion\n\nOnce you run the 10 rounds, you may begin with a discussion about the students’ experience during the activity with some of this questions:\n\n\n  Did any of you didn’t trade anything during a round? Why? (Maybe you could direct this answers to the complete-information assumption).\n  What conditions may be different from this experiment in a real potato market? Do you think they are relevant to the results?\n\n\nMeanwhile, your assistant will have some minutes to enter the lasting data to the Excel template. The document will provide you two graphics: average prices of transactions across rounds, and quantity of traded sacks across rounds.\n\n\n  What strategy did you use to find people to trade with? Did it change across rounds? (How does learning relate to information in a market? May this be reflected in the graphs?).\n  What do you think would have happened if every one of you had to trade at least one unit of potato (mandatory)?\n  What would have you done if transactions were subject to a minimum price: like (mention example price)?\n\n\n\n  Materials and resources\n\n\n",

Some of them:\n\n\n  Key concepts\n\n  \n    Market failures\n    Private marginal cost\n    External marginal cost\n    Social marginal cost\n    Consumer surplus\n    Producer surplus\n    Social surplus\n  \n\n\nIntroduction\n\nIs it always safe to trust markets to take society to the best possible scenario? Some situations may require adjustments.\n\nIf production or consumption of a good affect agents by a mechanism different from prices, market equilibriums are not necessarily Pareto efficient (Unit 12.1). This experiment reproduces a cars market. Consumers get a marginal benefit of buying a car: by driving to work, carrying objects, taking friends, etc. The result of this is an individual willingness to pay for a car. On the other hand, production of cars presents marginal costs. However, extensive cars trading generate massive externalities. Evidence shows that the use of fossil fuels has increased the level of CO2 in the atmosphere (Unit 1.5). Additionally, a massive traffic deteriorates the pavement. This generates additional costs in the use of cars. Particularly, time of travel increases with damaged roads.\n\nThis activity emulates a cars market where students take trading decisions. Half of the participants are assigned the role of cars producer firms. The rest of the students take the role of cars consumers. From a certain moment, a consumption externality is applied for massive use of cars. Theory describes how the social surplus is reduced by this externality. Equilibrium price is reduced; and, traded quantity decreases as well.\n\n\n  Get started\n\n\n",

During this time, roads have deteriorated using traded cars. In addition, the air has suffered a lost in its quality. Currently, you can perceive air pollution in the mornings while driving through the streets.\n  Given this new situation, consumers perceive less benefits for driving their cars. Therefore, if you are a consumer, you will have a willingness to pay equivalent to the one registered in your card minus (mention the size of the externality registered in the template. Then, give an example).\n\n\nClass discussion\n\nAfter round ten is over, motivate discussion with the next questions while the assistant finishes registering data. The template will generate graphics with the average prices of transactions and quantity of traded cars.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Aspect\n      Costs associated with externalities\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Learning\n      Utility is the benefit an individual perceives in relation with some associated costs. Even if pollution is a very different phenomenon compared to a decrease in roads, they all represent costs (damage to individual health, increases in travel times, etc.). That’s the reason why you can directly sum an abstract cost of externality to your individual benefit.\n    \n    \n      Question\n      Why would an increase in pollution or a decrease in roads quality affect individual marginal benefits of consumers?\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Aspect\n      Externalities information\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Learning\n      Even if externalities are not homogeneously perceivable by each individual, on average individuals perceive the existence of an effect of pollution, roads deterioration, etc. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume in a model that information affects people utilities equally.\n    \n    \n      Question\n      Do everyone perceive pollution and roads deterioration in the same way in real life?

Concepts students may explore are:\n\n\n  Key concepts\n\n  \n    Social dilemma\n    Public good\n    Free rider\n    Social punishment\n    Altruism\n  \n\n\nIntroduction\n\nAre humans able to pursue a goal as a whole species instead of blindly following their individual benefit? This question may be followed by hope.\n\nSome situations put individuals in conflict between what a person may want, and what would be best for the group (Unit 4). Public goods are characterized by being non-rival. Therefore, their availability to new people is not reduced by the current use of it (Unit 12.5). Thus, collective contribution to a public good is a clear example of this kind of conflict. In particular, there are individual incentives not to contribute to the good because once it’s available, everyone has access to it (Unit 4.6). Important problems have a similar nature. For instance, pollution and climate change require contributions from the agents to be addressed. However, there are individual incentives not to assume costs of actions against environmental problems because once reduced, the benefits are shared by everyone (Unit 20.9).\n\nThis activity presents a classic Public Goods Game. Participants get an endowment. They decide how much to contribute to a public good that will return an equal proportion of the sum of contributions multiplied by a number. Theory proposes that this game has a dominant strategy favoring not to contribute. Experimental evidence shows that contributions tend to decrease through time. However, when people is allowed to punish the free riders, contributions stay relatively constant (Unit 4.7).\n\n\n  Get started\n\n\n",

    content: "Experiment 7: Public Goods Game Running the experiment\n\nProtocol\n\nThis activity uses classEx platform. Before you run the experiment, you need login credentials. To learn how to get them read materials and resources section.\n\nAfter you configure your students’ access, you should enter the Public Goods Game in the Standard Games tab. You will find the general instructions for the students inside a box, as shown in figure 7.1.\n\nFigure 7.1. Admin page of the Public Goods Game\n\n\n\nYou should tell your students to enter the website and login with your same account credentials, except for the type of account and password. Figure 7.2 shows the screen your students should see.\n\nFigure 7.2. Login form for students\n\n\n\nOnce your students are logged, you should tell them the general instructions of the game and start it.\n\nWhile participants are taking their decisions, you will see the progress of each group and a bar to start every next round, as shown in figure 7.3.\n\nFigure 7.3. Progress reported in the admin page\n\n\n\nStudents will get feedback for each round they play, as shown in figure 7.4.\n\nFigure 7.4. Feedback in the participants’ screen\n\n\n\nOnce the rounds are finished, you may discuss the results with your students.\n\nClass discussion\n\nYou will get an immediate summary of the results in a graph calculated automatically by classEx platform, as you will see in figure 7.5.\n\nFigure 7.5. Summary graph after the experiment\n\n\n\nIt will display the aggregate contributions through time for each participant group. You should present this graph to your students and observe the general tendency. ¿Is it constant? ¿Does it decrease?\n\nThe next questions are suggested to trigger discussion:\n\n\n  \n    Which situations in real life may be similar to the game you just played? Are contributions to public goods repeated in time? How is this situation different to those proposed?\n  \n  \n    Who of you reduced contributions after rounds passed? Would you tell us why? (Try to relate their answer to an economic mechanism. For instance, if the student saw no contribution in the group, this would be similar to not having incentives to give more than others.)\n  \n  \n    Did any of you increase contributions? Why?\n  \n  \n    Hypothetical situation: Imagine our local government asks you to contribute to a children’s library in our city. You know you won’t use it because of the books it will save. Would you contribute? Why? (Use this situation to discuss about altruistic preferences.)\n  \n  \n    Would this context change the results of today’s activity? How would it be different?\n  \n  \n    Games theory predicts there is a dominant strategy of not contribution? How would you change the models to consider what we just discussed? Would you say the models predict rather well our results? For example, consider the tendency. Does it seem to converge to theory? How does your mental process in this game diverge from your mental process resolving a theoretical exercise? Does it matter?\n  \n\n\n\n  Materials and resources\n\n\n",

    content: "Glossary\n\n\nbox and whisker plotA graphic display of the range and quartiles of a distribution, where the first and third quartile form the ‘box’ and the maximum and minimum values form the ‘whiskers’.causationA direction from cause to effect, establishing that a change in one variable produces a change in another. While a correlation gives an indication of whether two variables move together (either in the same or opposite directions), causation means that there is a mechanism that explains this association. Example: We know that higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere lead to a greenhouse effect, which warms the Earth’s surface. Therefore we can say that higher CO2 levels are the cause of higher surface temperatures.conditional meanAn average of a variable, taken over a subgroup of observations that satisfy certain conditions, rather than all observations.confidence intervalA range of values that is centred around the sample value, and is defined so that there is a specified probability (usually 95%) that it contains the ‘true value’ of interest.contingent valuationA survey-based technique used to assess the value of non-market resources. Also known as: stated-preference model.correlation coefficientnumerical measure of how closely associated two variables are and whether they tend to take similar or dissimilar values, ranging from a value of 1, indicating that the variables take similar values (positively correlated), to −1, indicating that the variables take dissimilar variables (negative or inverse correlation). A value of 1 or −1 indicates that knowing the value of one of the variables would allow you to perfectly predict the value of the other. A value of 0 indicates that knowing one of the variables provides no information about the value of the other.correlationA measure of how closely related two variables are. Two variables are correlated if knowing the value of one variable provides information on the likely value of the other, for example high values of one variable being commonly observed along with high values of the other variable. Correlation can be positive or negative. It is negative when high values of one variable are observed with low values of the other. Correlation does not mean that there is a causal relationship between the variables. Example: When the weather is hotter, purchases of ice cream are higher. Temperature and ice cream sales are positively correlated. On the other hand, if purchases of hot beverages decrease when the weather is hotter, we say that temperature and hot beverage sales are negatively correlated.Cronbach’s alphaA measure used to assess the extent to which a set of items is a reliable or consistent measure of a concept. This measure ranges from 0–1, with 0 meaning that all of the items are independent of one another, and 1 meaning that all of the items are perfectly correlated with each other.cross-sectional dataData that is collected from participants at one point in time or within a relatively short time frame. In contrast, time series data refers to data collected by following an individual (or firm, country, etc.) over a course of time. Example: Data on degree courses taken by all the students in a particular university in 2016 is considered cross-sectional data. In contrast, data on degree courses taken by all students in a particular university from 1990 to 2016 is considered time series data.differences-in-differencesA method that applies an experimental research design to outcomes observed in a natural experiment. It involves comparing the difference in the average outcomes of two groups, a treatment and control group, both before and after the treatment took place.dummy variable (indicator variable)A variable that takes the value 1 if a certain condition is met, and 0 otherwise.endogenousProduced by the workings of a model rather than coming from outside the model. See also: exogenousexogenousComing from outside the model rather than being produced by the workings of the model itself. See also: endogenous.frequency tableA record of how many observations in a dataset have a particular value, range of values, or belong to a particular category.geometric meanA summary measure calculated by multiplying N numbers together and then taking the Nth root of this product. The geometric mean is useful when the items being averaged have different scoring indices or scales, because it is not sensitive to these differences, unlike the arithmetic mean. For example, if education ranged from 0 to 20 years and life expectancy ranged from 0 to 85 years, life expectancy would have a bigger influence on the HDI than education if we used the arithmetic mean rather than the geometric mean. Conversely, the geometric mean treats each criteria equally. Example: Suppose we use life expectancy and mean years of schooling to construct an index of wellbeing. Country A has life expectancy of 40 years and a mean of 6 years of schooling. If we used the arithmetic mean to make an index, we would get (40 + 6)/2 = 23. If we used the geometric mean, we would get (40 × 6)1/2 = 15.5.  Now suppose life expectancy doubled to 80 years. The arithmetic mean would be (80 + 6)/2 = 43, and the geometric mean would be (80 × 6)1/2 = 21.9. If, instead, mean years of schooling doubled to 12 years, the arithmetic mean would be (40 + 12)/2 = 26, and the geometric mean would be (40 × 12)1/2 = 21.9. This example shows that the arithmetic mean can be ‘unfair’ because proportional changes in one variable (life expectancy) have a larger influence over the index than changes in the other variable (years of schooling). The geometric mean gives each variable the same influence over the value of the index, so doubling the value of one variable would have the same effect on the index as doubling the value of another variable.Gini coefficientA measure of inequality of any quantity such as income or wealth, varying from a value of zero (if there is no inequality) to one (if a single individual receives all of it).indexAn index is formed by aggregating the values of multiple items into a single value, and is used as a summary measure of an item of interest. Example: The HDI is a summary measure of wellbeing, and is calculated by aggregating the values for life expectancy, expected years of schooling, mean years of schooling, and gross national income per capita.inflationAn increase in the general price level in the economy. Usually measured over a year. See also: deflation, disinflation.leverage ratio (for banks or households)The value of assets divided by the equity stake (capital contributed by owners and shareholders) in those assets.leverage ratio (for non-bank companies)The value of total liabilities divided by total assets.Likert scaleA numerical scale (usually ranging from 1–5 or 1–7) used to measure attitudes or opinions, with each number representing the individual’s level of agreement or disagreement with a particular statement.Lorenz curveA graphical representation of inequality of some quantity such as wealth or income. Individuals are arranged in ascending order by how much of this quantity they have, and the cumulative share of the total is then plotted against the cumulative share of the population. For complete equality of income, for example, it would be a straight line with a slope of one. The extent to which the curve falls below this perfect equality line is a measure of inequality. See also: Gini coefficient.natural experimentAn empirical study exploiting naturally occurring statistical controls in which researchers do not have the ability to assign participants to treatment and control groups, as is the case in conventional experiments. Instead, differences in law, policy, weather, or other events can offer the opportunity to analyse populations as if they had been part of an experiment. The validity of such studies depends on the premise that the assignment of subjects to the naturally occurring treatment and control groups can be plausibly argued to be random.p-valueThe probability of observing the data collected, assuming that the two groups have the same mean. The p-value ranges from 0 to 1, where lower values indicate a higher probability that the underlying assumption (same means) is false. The lower the probability (the lower the p-value), the less likely it is to observe the given data, and therefore the more likely it is that the assumption is false (the means of both distributions is not the same).principal–agent relationshipThis is an asymmetrical relationship in which one party (the principal) benefits from some action or attribute of the other party (the agent) about which the principal’s information is not sufficient to enforce in a complete contract. See also: incomplete contract. Also known as: principal–agent problem.rangeThe interval formed by the smallest (minimum) and the largest (maximum) value of a particular variable. The range shows the two most extreme values in the distribution, and can be used to check whether there are any outliers in the data. (Outliers are a few observations in the data that are very different from the rest of the observations.)selection biasAn issue that occurs when the sample or data observed is not representative of the population of interest. For example, individuals with certain characteristics may be more likely to be part of the sample observed (such as students being more likely than CEOs to participate in computer lab experiments).significance levelA cut-off probability that determines whether a p-value is considered statistically significant. If a p-value is smaller than the significance level, it is considered unlikely that the differences observed are due to chance, given the assumptions made about the variables (for example, having the same mean). Common significance levels are 1% (p-value of 0.01), 5% (p-value of 0.05), and 10% (p-value of 0.1). See also: statistically significant, p-value.simultaneityWhen the right-hand and left-hand variables in a model equation affect each other at the same time, so that the direction of causality runs both ways. For example, in supply and demand models, the market price affects the quantity supplied and demanded, but quantity supplied and demanded can in turn affect the market price.spurious correlationA strong linear association between two variables that does not result from any direct relationship, but instead may be due to coincidence or to another unseen factor.standard deviationA measure of dispersion in a frequency distribution, equal to the square root of the variance. The standard deviation has a similar interpretation to the variance. A larger standard deviation means that the data is more spread out. Example: The set of numbers 1, 1, 1 has a standard deviation of zero (no variation or spread), while the set of numbers 1, 1, 999 has a standard deviation of 46.7 (large spread).statistically significantWhen a relationship between two or more variables is unlikely to be due to chance, given the assumptions made about the variables (for example, having the same mean). Statistical significance does not tell us whether there is a causal link between the variables.time series dataA time series is a set of time-ordered observations of a variable taken at successive, in most cases regular, periods or points of time. Example: The population of a particular country in the years 1990, 1991, 1992, … , 2015 is time series data.varianceA measure of dispersion in a frequency distribution, equal to the mean of the squares of the deviations from the arithmetic mean of the distribution. The variance is used to indicate how ‘spread out’ the data is. A higher variance means that the data is more spread out. Example: The set of numbers 1, 1, 1 has zero variance (no variation), while the set of numbers 1, 1, 999 has a high variance of 2178 (large spread).weighted averageA type of average that assigns greater importance (weight) to some components than to others, in contrast with a simple average, which weights each component equally. Components with a larger weight can have a larger influence on the average.\n\n",
